libnss-gw-name
==============

The libnss-gw-name name service switch module resolves the name
“gateway.current” to the IP address of the gateway of the currently
configured default route.

Manual installation
===================

The Debian package takes automatically care of setting up libnss-gw-name.
To compile libnss-gw-name manually, you need to have the libnl library
installed (libnl-dev on Debian) and then run 

$ make && make install

To make the system actually use this NSS module, add it to the list of
hosts modules in /etc/nsswitch.conf:

hosts:          files gw_name dns
